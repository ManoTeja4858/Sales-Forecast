# Sales Forecast for Store

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end pipeline for store sales forecasting, including data cleaning, multiple machine learning models, and result evaluation. The goal was to identify the best-performing model for sales prediction. All work was conducted using **Google Colab**.

## üìÇ Project Structure
1. **Data Cleaning** (`data_cleaning.ipynb`): Preprocessing and cleaning the dataset for modeling.
2. **Regression Models** (`regression_model.ipynb`): Implementation of traditional regression techniques.
3. **Amira Model** (`amira_model.ipynb`): A custom Amira model for advanced forecasting.
4. **Results** (`results.ipynb`): Evaluation and comparison of all models with detailed results.

## üß† Machine Learning Models
Five different machine learning models were implemented and compared:
1. **Linear Regression**: A baseline model.
2. **Random Forest**: A robust ensemble model.
3. **XGBoost**: Gradient-boosted trees for improved performance.
4. **LSTM**: A deep learning model for sequential data.
5. **Amira Model**: A custom-designed model for sales forecasting.

## üî¨ Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: 
    - Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
    - Feature engineering to create additional useful predictors.
2. **Model Implementation**:
    - Trained and tuned each of the five models using grid search or hyperparameter optimization.
3. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Models were evaluated using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R¬≤.
    - Comparative analysis was performed to determine the best model.

## üìä Results
| Model              | MAE   | RMSE  | R¬≤    |
|--------------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Linear Regression  | X.XX  | X.XX  | X.XX  |
| Random Forest      | X.XX  | X.XX  | X.XX  |
| XGBoost            | X.XX  | X.XX  | X.XX  |
| LSTM               | X.XX  | X.XX  | X.XX  |
| Amira Model        | X.XX  | X.XX  | X.XX  |

The **best-performing model** was **[insert best model name]**, achieving the lowest error metrics.

## üöÄ Key Insights
- Model comparison revealed that [insert best model name] was most effective due to [reason why it performed better].
- Data preprocessing significantly improved the overall model performance.
- Ensemble models like XGBoost and Random Forest provided better results than traditional regression methods.
